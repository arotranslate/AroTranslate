<br>
Aromanian is an endangered Eastern Romance dialectal language spoken mainly in Greece, but also in Albania, North Macedonia, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and is most similar with Romanian. (wiki)
<br> 
This repository contains the deployment of the first automatic translator for Aromanian. Used NLLB-200-600M [1] for fine-tuning under the CC-BY-NC-4.0 license.
