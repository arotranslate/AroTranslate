This repository contains the deployment of the first automatic translator for Aromanian. Used [NLLB-200-600M](https://huggingface.co/facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M) for fine-tuning under the CC-BY-NC-4.0 license.
Unquanitzed model [here](https://huggingface.co/alexjerpelea/NLLB-aromanian-romanian-v1) and quantized model [here](https://huggingface.co/alexjerpelea/NLLB-aromanian-romanian-v1-ctranslate2). Collected dataset [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/alexjerpelea/aromanian-romanian-MT-corpus). Please request access as all of these are gated.
