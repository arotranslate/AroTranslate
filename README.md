# The first neural machine translation system for the Aromanian Language

Aromanian is an endagered Romance language spoken in the Balkans, similar to Romanian. 
We present the first comprehensive Aromanian Translator, a 100k+ sentences aromanian - romanian corpus, and other deliverables, in support of the Aromanian tongue and its speakers.

## Motivation

Aromanian is an Eastern Romance language, part of the Proto-Romanian language family. With more than 300k speakers, it has a rich cultural heritage but remains underrepresented in modern technological advancements, particularly in the field of natural language processing. 
<br><br>
Spoken mainly in Greece, Albania, Romania but also North Macedonia, Bulgaria, and Serbia, the Aromanian language has the [endangered](https://endangeredlanguages.com/lang/963) status as speakers tend to assimilate more and more with their national language and culture, and do not pass the tongue to the new generations.
<br><br>
There are very little initiatives for supporting the Aromanian language, mostly due to the governments lack of support. It is only oficially recognized in [North Macedonia and Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromanian_language#:~:text=2021%20Australian%20census.-,Official%20status,subject%20in%20some%20primary%20schools.). 
<br><br>
This project, through the tools and data it presents, aims to:
- make digital content more accesible
- allow young Aromanians (and not only) to reconnect with their languages
- increase interest for this subject, especially within the academic medium


# The first neural machine translation system for the Aromanian language

<br>
Aromanian is an endangered Eastern Romance dialectal language spoken mainly in Greece, but also in Albania, North Macedonia, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and is most similar with Romanian. (wiki)
<br> 
This repository contains the deployment of the first automatic translator for Aromanian. Used NLLB-200-600M [1] for fine-tuning under the CC-BY-NC-4.0 license.
<br>
Delivering the unquanitzed model [2], quantized model [3], and romanian-aromanian corpus[4]. Please request access as all of these are momentarily gated.
